# About is code-formatter
I have started programming a PHP source code formatting tool in PHP which shpould aim to replace PHP_Beautifier. I had startet developing the tool and an idea rose to have a full HTML5 WYSIWYG formatting styler which can read and save your own rule set. As of PHP, that would be for exampel the PEAR coding standard.

So I decided to stop work on the PHP tool and re-create it in JavaScript for in-browser use and to use it within node.js as command-line tool.
